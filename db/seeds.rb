          We pride ourselves on being a quiet family site. We let a pitch to you with the expectation that you will follow the usual customs of good camping and caravanning. We reserve the right to ask you to leave at any point of your stay if the behaviour of any member of your party is unacceptable to us and no refund of monies will be paid.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pitch price includes two adults (or 1 adult, 1 child). There are extra charges for additional children 3 -  16 yrs, awnings,  gazebos, dogs, extra adults and cars. It is your responsibility to ensure that you can fit both your vehicle and single unit on the 10 x 6 metre pitch allocated to you. If you decide to bring extras, these must fit within the pitch.  We only allow 1 unit per pitch, so those wanting to bring additional tents or accommodation must book separately.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will confirm your booking indicating that a pitch has been reserved for you on the dates required.  The pitch offered will be based upon the information supplied by you.
        </p>
        <p>You may request a specific pitch, BUT THIS IS NOT GUARANTEED.</p>
        <p>
          You can cancel your booking anytime up to 28 days before your stay with no additional charges.  Cancellation by you within 28 days of your booking due to inclement weather, non arrival of party members, arrival after the due date or events beyond our control are non-refundable.
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
          You must pitch as directed by the ground staff, not encroach upon any other pitches and consider fire risk limitation, safety and access. If you pitch outside the boundaries of your pitch or your unit is judged to pose a risk to the safety and comfort of others you will be asked to move.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any verbal and/or physical abuse to staff or guests will result in immediate expulsion from the site.  Belongings and vehicles can be collected at a later date, through prior arrangement with the management and landlord.
        </p>
        <p>
        If there is a problem or dissatisfaction with any matters under our control, please notify us immediately, so we may have the opportunity to rectify issues.  We cannot accept liability in relation to any claim of whatever nature if you fail to notify us within seven days from the end of your stay with us.
